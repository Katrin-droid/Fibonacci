# Fibonacci
Unity application 

Instructions:
Go to folder Scenes and open Fibonacci Scene
Click the play button and you will hear light music in the background (not too loud, not too quiet)
You will see a text field where you can specify how many fibonacci numbers you want (I would suggest to generate either 1 or 20),
if none are generated the appplication will crash!
After you typed in the desired number press the button "Generate" and you will see the numbers appear!

This is a very simple yet well working script, it does a very simple callculation in order to display the fibonacci numbers.
The Design is as simple as possible, the theme is calming this you can notice with the light colors, sounds are added, light music in the background,
when pressing a button you will hear a light click..
